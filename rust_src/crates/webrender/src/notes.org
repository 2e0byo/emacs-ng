- The old glutin api used Contexts
- The new glutin api abstracts a lot of the GL Context into a (higher-level)

Clone the emacs-ng repo, and then run `./autogen.sh` and `./compile
--with-webrender --without-javascript`.

This builds and configures everything it can.

Then run cargo from the *root* crate, i.e. `cd rust_src && cargo build`.

Since we're working against a new version of webrender which hasn't been
published yet, clone the repo and run `cargo doc`.  The documentation is then in `target/doc/webrender`.
